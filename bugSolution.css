The solution involves restructuring the CSS selectors to ensure that the hover effect is correctly applied. Instead of using `.parent:hover .child`, we will use a more specific selector to target only the child element within the hovered parent container.

```css
.container {
display: flex;
}

.parent {
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
border: 1px solid black;
}

.child {
width: 50px;
height: 50px;
background-color: red;
}

.parent:hover > .child {
background-color: blue;
}
```

By using `>`, we explicitly select only direct children.  This resolves the issue.
